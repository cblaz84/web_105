                JET stands for the Japanese Exchange and Teaching Program and is a
                japanese government initative that brings college graduates, mostly native speakers of English, to Japan as Assistant Language
                teachers. It is meant to help facilitate english learning within early schooling for children and teenagers. While there, JETs are 
                employed as Assistant teachers and provided housing. I am aiming to become a JET after college and hope to be able to stay as a teacher.

                My older brother was a JET for 2 years, during this time he lived in Japan, specifically the city of Ishinomaki. He was an 
                Assistant language teacher at several schools, manily primary schools and elementary schools. He also did help at some middle 
                schools. My brother recalls his time in Japan very fondly. He greatly enjoyed meeting and interacting with the people there and
                experiencing so many new and wonderful things.
