                    Japan has always been a place I want to visit within my lifetime. I admire both the culture and language of the country and
                    am very interested in seeing it for myself. I hope to be able to travel there during or sometime soon after college. I became
                    interested in Japanese culture through playing games from Nintendo and have grown interested in other aspects like language and 
                    food. I have started to try to learn some basic Japanese, and while I am by no means proficient yet, I hope to become somewhat 
                    knowledeable so that I am ready to travel there.

                speak towards one of my favorite aspects of Japanese culture, the <b>Food</b>, and also give information on a program called
                <b>JET</b>. I learned of this program through my older brother Tyler who lived in Japan thanks to this program. I hope by reading
                this website you establish an interest in Japan and it's culture and learn something you may not have known before. Japan is a 
                wonderful country and I can't wait to visit there.</p>
