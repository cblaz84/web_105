                        <h2>Eponine</h2>
                        <p>
                            Éponine Thénardier is the cynical but resourceful and street-smart eldest daughter and first-born
                             child of Monsieur and Madame Thénardier. She lived a comfortable and spoiled childhood and throughout her teen and
                             adult years she and her family are impoverished. Cosette stays with her family at their inn for the beginning of their 
                             childhoods and is treated poorly compared to Eponine, only for their situations to reverse in the coming years, with 
                             Cosette living a rather easy life while Eponine is poor and near starving. She falls in love with Marius, only for her love
                             to be unrequited as he loves Cosette. This is another area where Cosette seems to have eveything Eponine wants.

                        <h2>Fantine</h2>
                        <p>
                            Fantine is a poor, working-class girl from the desolate seacoast town of Montreuil-sur-mer,
                             an orphan who has almost no education and can neither read nor write. Fantine is inevitably
                              betrayed by the people she does trust: Tholomyès gets her pregnant and then disappears; the
                               Thénardiers take Cosette and use the child to extort more money; and Fantine’s coworkers have
                                her fired for indecency. In his descriptions of Fantine’s life and death, Hugo highlights
                                 the unfair attitude of French society toward women and the poor. Fantine’s fellow citizens
                                  criticize her for her behavior and depravity, but they also take every opportunity to make
                                   her circumstances even more desperate.

                        <h2>Jean Val Jean</h2>
                        <p>
                            Jean Valjean is the protagonist of Victor Hugo's 1862 novel Les Misérables. The story depicts the
                             character's 19-year-long struggle to lead a normal life after serving a prison sentence for stealing
                              bread to feed his sister's children during a time of economic depression and various attempts to
                               escape from prison. Valjean is also known in the novel as Monsieur Madeleine, Ultime Fauchelevent,
                                Monsieur Leblanc, and Urbain Fabre. He is a parallel to Inspector Javear, and he is portrayed by Hugh
                                Jackman in the movie.
