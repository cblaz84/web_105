                            Les Miserables is a critically acclaimed novel that centers itself around the 1832 "June Rebellion" of France.
                            (Not to be confused with the French Revolution of 1789 with King Louis the XVI) The main character is Jean Val Jean,
                            an ex-convict who becomes the guardian of a young orphan girl. He is on the run from Inspector Javear. The young
                            girl he is in charge of, Cosette, grows up and falls in love with a man named Marius, who starts getting involved
                            in the revolution. Many other characters like the Thernadiers, Eponine, Fantine, and more are important but it's 
                            hard to summarize this book due to how much is going on.

                            Due to it's popularity and status as a classic, there have been many reiterations of this tale, including a musical
                            and movie. The musical itself has become one of the most famous musicals in history, with songs like "I Dreamed a Dream",
                            "Do You Hear People Sing?" and "One Day More" have helped establish Les Miserables as one of the most well-known musicals
                            to this day. Personally, my favorite song is "I Dreamed a Dream". I think Anne Hathaway did a really great job potraying
                            the sadness and despair of Fantine's life and situation. I mean this whole musical is kinda depressing in some ways, but I 
                            feel like Fantine is one of the most tragic characters and this song really conveys that. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulJXiB5i_q0" target="blank">Click here</a>
                            to view "I Dreamed a Dream" from the movie version. It's one of my favorite scenes, even though it's so sad.
