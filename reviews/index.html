<h1>HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE</h1>
   <h2>By: J.K. Rowling</h2>
<img src="harry-potter-4077473_640.png" alt="Harry Potter and Hedwig">
<h3>Overview</h3>
         <p> Harry Potter is a lonely and sad orphan, mistreated and abused by his extended family.
        His “family” constantly reminds him that he does not really belong as part of their family 
        and he feels completely alone and unwanted. That is until he learns he is actually a wizard!? 
        On his twelfth birthday he is invited to attend Hogwarts, a school of <i>wizardy</i>.
        It is here that Harry’s story begins and where he finds where he truly belongs.</p>

        <p>This story is not only about Harry finding where he belongs and living happily. He may find his new
            home a safe refuge from his old tormenting relatives, but new dangers await Harry at Hogwarts, and 
            an ancient evil long thought gone seems to be awakening with Harry's return. Harry, alongside his 
            new friends he finds at Hogwarts, must help protect his new home and defeat the rising evil.
        </p>
<!--This book has a very strong theme of belonging, as Harry has felt out of place for most of his life. I tried
to emphasize this theme in my summary/review of the book-->
        <p>“Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone” is a charming and imaginative tale about a young boy finding 
        where he belongs. The story follows the protagonist, Harry Potter, as he discovers a magical world and 
        his place within it. From the wondrous world-building to the lovable characters, readers will
        thoroughly enjoy this novel at any age. Just from personal experience, I was able to connect with many
        of the characters and had an absolutely great time reading the book. I couldn't wait to get a hold of hold
        of the next book in the series.“It was a dream, I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going
         to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I’ll be at home in my cupboard.” (p. 61)
    </p>

<h3>Harry Potter: the Series</h3>
        <p>This being only the first in J.K. Rowling’s long series that follows Harry, it serves as a proper 
        introduction to this new world. The reader is able to properly integrate themselves and slowly grow 
        accustomed to this new world as Harry also adjusts. The series as a whole is a beautiful tale of growth
        and friendship that all readers can appreciate and enjoy. It is critically acclaimed and it is quite rare 
        to find someone who has not read the Harry Potter Series, or, at the very least, heard of them. </p>
